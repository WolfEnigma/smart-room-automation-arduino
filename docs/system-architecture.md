# System Architecture

The system architecture consists of two main controllers: NodeMCU ESP8266 and Arduino Uno.

- NodeMCU handles environmental automation and IoT communication
- Arduino Uno controls the secure door locking mechanism

Sensors provide real-time data to the controllers, which process the inputs and activate output devices such as relays, motors, buzzers, and locks. The architecture ensures low latency, efficient power usage, and modular expansion capability.
