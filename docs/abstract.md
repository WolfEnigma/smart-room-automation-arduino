# Abstract

This project focuses on the design and implementation of an Automated Smart Room using Arduino Uno and NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontrollers. The system automates essential household functions such as lighting, temperature control, fire detection, and security using sensor-based decision-making.

The smart room includes an LDR-based lighting system, temperature-controlled fan operation using DHT sensors, smoke detection using an MQ-2 sensor, and a rain-triggered clothes rope retraction mechanism. A password-protected magnetic door lock enhances security, while an ultrasonic sensor-based smart dustbin improves hygiene.

The system operates on a 12V SMPS power supply and is developed within a limited budget of Rs. 10,000. The project demonstrates the feasibility of an affordable, scalable, and energy-efficient smart home solution with potential for future IoT and AI-based enhancements.
