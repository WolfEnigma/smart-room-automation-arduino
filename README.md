# Automated Smart Room – IoT Based Home Automation System

## Project Overview
The Automated Smart Room project is a low-cost IoT-based home automation system designed to enhance convenience, security, and energy efficiency. The system integrates Arduino Uno and NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontrollers with multiple sensors to automate common household functions.

## Objectives
- To design an energy-efficient smart room automation system
- To automate lighting, temperature control, and safety mechanisms
- To implement a secure smart door locking system
- To demonstrate an affordable and scalable home automation model

## Key Features
- Automatic lighting using LDR
- Temperature-based fan/blower control
- Smoke and fire detection using MQ-2 sensor
- Rain-based clothes rope retraction system
- Smart dustbin using ultrasonic sensor
- Password-protected magnetic door lock
- IoT-based monitoring using NodeMCU ESP8266

## Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Embedded C (Arduino IDE)
- Sensors: DHT11, LDR, MQ-2, Rain Sensor, HC-SR04
- 12V SMPS Power Supply
