# Power Supply Design

The system uses a 12V Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS) capable of delivering up to 10A. SMPS was selected due to its high efficiency, compact size, and voltage stability.

The power supply distributes regulated voltage to:
- Microcontrollers
- Sensors
- Relays
- Motors and solenoid locks

This ensures uninterrupted and safe operation of the smart room system.
